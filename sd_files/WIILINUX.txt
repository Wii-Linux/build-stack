=== Wii Linux SD Card Files ===

These files are for booting Wii Linux,
but they are also the main FAT32 partition of your SD Card.

If you are looking to modify the filesystem contents of your Wii (the rootfs),
you are looking in the wrong place.
These are the files necessary to begin the boot process.
You should really not touch these unless you know what you are doing,
or you were asked to do so by one of the developers for fixing a bug.

The list of related files/folders is here.  If you were looking for a different file,
you're probably fine to do whatever you want to it.
Don't touch these:
- gumboot (entire folder)
- bootmii/armboot.elf
- bootmii/ppcboot.elf

If you were going for any of these, or anything not listed, you're fine:
- apps
- games
