	<short_description>Wii Linux {{fullver}} - IOS verion</short_description>
	<long_description>A port of Linux {{fullver}} to the Nintendo Wii.
In contrast to the standard version that launches via Gumboot, which replaces BootMii, this version launches via the Homebrew Channel, or your preferred method of launching standard Wii homebrew.
This version uses the standard "IOS" firmware for the Starlet, rather than MINI &amp; Gumboot.
This unfortunately means that there's less hardware support, though, so be aware of the following items that you lose with this version:
- USB 2.0 access (could be added, but isn't yet).
- DVD access (same as above)
- A little bit of RAM
- Probably more that I'm forgetting as of writing
